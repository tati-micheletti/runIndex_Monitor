#' Combined multi-species index, per grid cell, per year -- a regional
#' rather than national version of `computeCombinedIndex()`
#'
#' Same geometric-mean logic as the national combined index
#' (`SBI_t = exp(mean(log(index_i,t)))` across species `i`), but computed
#' independently at every cell of a `cellSizeM` grid instead of once for
#' the whole country -- i.e. baseline-normalization AND the cross-species
#' geometric mean both happen cell-by-cell, using `terra` raster algebra
#' (each operation below acts on every cell simultaneously). The result is
#' a map of "how has the multi-species index changed here" instead of one
#' number for all of Germany.
#'
#' A species is excluded from a given cell's geometric mean wherever its
#' own baseline-year value there is too close to zero to divide by
#' (`minBaseline`) -- the per-cell analogue of a species just not being
#' present at that location; it doesn't break the calculation, that
#' species' signal there is simply absent, same principle as
#' `computeCombinedIndex()` dropping a species missing a whole year.
#'
#' @param species Character vector of Latin species names.
#' @param years Integer vector of years.
#' @param baselineYear Integer. Index baseline (must be in `years`).
#' @param metaDir Character. `metaModel()`'s output directory.
#' @param cellSizeM Numeric. Grid cell size in meters (e.g. 20000, 50000).
#' @param minBaseline Numeric. Per-cell baseline values below this are
#'   treated as "species effectively absent here" and excluded from that
#'   cell's geometric mean, rather than producing a huge/unstable ratio.
#' @param countryBoundary SpatVector or NULL, passed through to
#'   `aggregateSpeciesToGrid()` -- see its docstring. Cropping this early
#'   (not just at final display) keeps non-German source cells out of
#'   every step downstream, including `smoothGriddedIndex()`.
#' @return SpatRaster, one layer per year (named by year), at `cellSizeM`
#'   resolution.
