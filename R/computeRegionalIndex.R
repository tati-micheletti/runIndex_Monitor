#' Build regional (gridded + smoothed) combined-index maps at several
#' resolutions, for direct comparison
#'
#' Ties together `computeGriddedCombinedIndex()` and `smoothGriddedIndex()`
#' for each requested cell size, writing both the raw gridded raster and
#' its smoothed version for each -- so e.g. a 20km and a 50km version can
#' be compared side by side, raw and smoothed, rather than committing to
#' one resolution.
#'
#' @param species Character vector of Latin species names.
#' @param years Integer vector of years.
#' @param baselineYear Integer. Index baseline.
#' @param metaDir Character. `metaModel()`'s output directory.
#' @param outputDir Character. Directory to save outputs in.
#' @param cellSizesM Numeric vector. Grid cell sizes to compute, in meters.
#'   Required, no default -- deliberately: which resolutions to produce is
#'   a real decision (see `sharedRegionalCellSizesM` in `sharedConfig.R`,
#'   the canonical answer), not something this function should silently
#'   fall back to. Every caller should pass `sharedRegionalCellSizesM`
#'   rather than typing cell sizes inline.
#' @param smoothRadiusFactor Numeric. Passed to `smoothGriddedIndex()`.
#' @param countryBoundary SpatVector or NULL, passed through to
#'   `computeGriddedCombinedIndex()`/`aggregateSpeciesToGrid()`. Strongly
#'   recommended (e.g. GADM level-0 Germany, as `tools/maskToGermany.R`
#'   already fetches) -- without it, cells straddling the border can
#'   quietly average in non-German source data; see
#'   `aggregateSpeciesToGrid()`'s docstring.
#' @return Invisibly, a named list (by cell size, as character e.g.
#'   `"20000"`) of `list(raw = SpatRaster, smoothed = SpatRaster)`.
#'   Everything is also written to `outputDir` as
#'   `regional_index_<cellSizeKm>km_raw.tif` /
#'   `regional_index_<cellSizeKm>km_smoothed.tif`.
